User Request: <start of user request> How many tables, excluding nested ones, does the JSON object contain in the data source? Explain how you determine their number. <end of user request>
Response Text: The JSON object contains 105 tables. This count is determined by counting the number of distinct "table_name" entries in the JSON object, excluding any nested JSON objects or arrays that might be within each table's details. Each table is represented as a separate JSON object within the array, and the "table_name" field uniquely identifies each table.
