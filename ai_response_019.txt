User Request: <start of user request> Total ad spend for last 90 days for Facebook, TikTok, Google and Apple Search <end of user request>
Response Text: To find the total ad spend for the last 90 days for Facebook, TikTok, Google, and Apple Search, we need to look for tables with daily granularity that include ad spend data and have been updated recently to cover the last 90 days from the current date, which is January 5, 2024. We will prioritize tables with the most recent "freshness_date".

After sorting the tables by "freshness_date", the following tables are suitable:

1) For Facebook:
- "ads_6937_facebook_all_data" (freshness_date: "2023-03-10") is not suitable because it does not cover the last 90 days.
- "ads_creative_6937_facebook_all_data" (freshness_date: "2023-01-02") is not suitable for the same reason.
- "ads_placements_6937_facebook_all_data" (freshness_date: "2023-12-28") is suitable because it covers the last 90 days and includes ad spend data.
- "campaign_6937_facebook_all_data" (freshness_date: "2023-01-02") is not suitable for the same reason as above.
- "device_by_campaign_6937_facebook_all_data" (freshness_date: "2023-09-21") is not suitable because it does not cover the last 90 days.

2) For TikTok:
- "ads_6937_tiktok_ads_all_data" (freshness_date: "2023-12-28") is suitable because it covers the last 90 days and includes ad spend data.
- "ads_dma_6937_tiktok_ads_all_data" (freshness_date: "2023-12-28") is suitable for the same reason as above.

3) For Google:
- "campaign_6937_google_ads_ql_all_data" (freshness_date: "2023-12-28") is suitable because it covers the last 90 days and includes ad spend data.
- "ads_6937_google_ads_ql_all_data" (freshness_date: "2023-04-15") is not suitable because it does not cover the last 90 days.

4) For Apple Search:
- "ads_6937_apple_search_all_data" (freshness_date: "2023-12-28") is suitable because it covers the last 90 days and includes ad spend data.

Now, we will select the most suitable table for each platform, ensuring that we have one table per platform and that the data source is the same. Here are the selected tables:

- Facebook: "ads_placements_6937_facebook_all_data"
- TikTok: "ads_6937_tiktok_ads_all_data"
- Google: "campaign_6937_google_ads_ql_all_data"
- Apple Search: "ads_6937_apple_search_all_data"

Here is the JSON output with the suitable tables:

```
{
"data": [
 {"pros": "Covers last 90 days, includes ad spend data", "freshness": "2023-12-28", "score": "9", "table_name": "ads_placements_6937_facebook_all_data"},

}
