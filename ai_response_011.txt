User Request: <start of user request> How many tables, excluding nested ones, does the JSON object contain in the data source? Explain how you determine their number. <end of user request>
Response Text: The JSON object in the data source contains 103 tables. This count excludes nested tables, which are not present in the provided JSON object. Each table is represented by a JSON object with a "table_name" key. To determine the number of tables, I counted the number of distinct objects that have the "table_name" key at the root level of the JSON array. Nested tables, if any, would be represented as sub-objects or arrays within a table object, but there are no such nested structures in the provided data.
