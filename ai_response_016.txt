User Request: <start of user request> Total ad spend for last 90 days for Facebook, TikTok, Google and Apple Search <end of user request>
Response Text: To find the total ad spend for the last 90 days for Facebook, TikTok, Google, and Apple Search, we need to look for tables with daily granularity that include ad spend data and have been updated recently to cover the last 90 days from the current date, which is January 5, 2024. We will prioritize tables with the most recent "freshness_date".

After sorting the tables by "freshness_date", the following tables are suitable:

1) For Facebook:
- "ads_6937_facebook_all_data" (freshness_date: "2023-03-10") is not suitable because it does not cover the last 90 days.
- "ads_creative_6937_facebook_all_data" (freshness_date: "2023-01-02") is not suitable for the same reason.
- "ads_placements_6937_facebook_all_data" (freshness_date: "2023-12-28") is suitable because it covers the last 90 days and includes ad spend data.
- "campaign_6937_facebook_all_data" (freshness_date: "2023-01-02") is not suitable for the same reason as the first two.
- "device_by_campaign_6937_facebook_all_data" (freshness_date: "2023-09-21") is not suitable because it does not cover the last 90 days.

2) For TikTok:
- "ads_6937_tiktok_ads_all_data" (freshness_date: "2023-12-28") is suitable because it covers the last 90 days and includes ad spend data.

3) For Google:
- "ads_6937_google_ads_ql_all_data" (freshness_date: "2023-04-15") is not suitable because it does not cover the last 90 days.
- "campaign_6937_google_ads_ql_all_data" (freshness_date: "2023-12-28") is suitable because it covers the last 90 days and includes ad spend data.

4) For Apple Search:
- "ads_6937_apple_search_all_data" (freshness_date: "2023-12-28") is suitable because it covers the last 90 days and includes ad spend data.

Here is the JSON output with the suitable tables:

    {
